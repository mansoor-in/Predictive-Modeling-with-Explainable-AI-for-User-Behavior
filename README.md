# Predictive Modeling with Explainable AI for User Behavior

This project builds predictive models to analyze and forecast user behavior patterns. It incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide transparency and interpretability for model predictions, helping to uncover actionable insights.

## Features
- Predictive Modeling: Leverages machine learning to predict user behavior.
- Explainable AI: Uses tools like SHAP or LIME to interpret model predictions.
- Data Visualization: Generates graphs and charts to highlight key behavioral insights.
- Transparency and Interpretability: Ensures that predictions are understandable and actionable.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-modeling-xai.git
   cd predictive-modeling-xai
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open `Predictive_Modeling_with_Explainable_AI_for_User_Behavior.ipynb` to explore the code.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `shap` or `lime`

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Load your dataset into the notebook.
2. **Model Training**: Train predictive models on the prepared data.
3. **Explain Predictions**: Use XAI tools to interpret model outcomes.
4. **Visualization**: View results through charts and interpret findings.

## File Structure
- `Predictive_Modeling_with_Explainable_AI_for_User_Behavior.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the code and explanations.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for the project.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with advanced XAI techniques for deeper interpretability.
- Apply deep learning models to analyze complex user behaviors.
- Develop an API for real-time predictive insights.
